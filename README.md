# Optimising Customer Support Operations at Delwarca Software 

## Executive Summary:
This project presents a comprehensive Business Analysis and Operational Research initiative focused on optimising the call handling operations of Delwarca Software's Remote Support Unit (RSU). The RSU was facing escalating customer dissatisfaction due to persistent long wait times and operational inefficiencies, despite the implementation of a new "Rapid ID" call routing procedure. This analysis aims to diagnose the root causes of these issues, evaluate the performance of existing systems, and propose data-driven solutions to enhance customer service, optimise resource utilisation, and improve overall operational efficiency. 

## Business Problem:
Delwarca software's RSU, responsible for providing technical support, observed a decline in customer satisfaction directly linked to extended wait times. The "Rapid ID" system, intended to streamline calls by triaging them through "Director Associates", failed to significantly alleviate customer frustration and, in some aspects, exacerbated workload imbalances among support staff. The project addresses the critical need to identify effective strategies to reduce customer queuing times, optimise the allocation of Associates and Senior Associates, and restore positive customer perception within budgetary constraints. 


## Project Objectives:
* To conduct a thorough analysis of the "Pre-Rapid ID" and "Rapid ID" call handling processes.
* To identify and quantify operational bottlenecks and inefficiencies within the RSU.
* To assess the utilisation rates and workload distribution of Associates and Senior Associates.
* To leverage simulation modelling to validate current system performance and test alternative operational strategies.
* To propose data-backed recommendations for process re-engineering and resource optimisation to improve customer satisfaction and RSU efficiency.

## Methodology and Approach:
The project adopted a structured Business Analysis approach combined with quantitative and simulation-based methodologies:
1. **Problem Definition and Stakeholder Contextualisation**: Initial investigation into customer feedback, managemet directives, and staff concerns to fram the core business problem and understand diverse stakeholder perspectives.
2. **Current State Process Mapping**: Detailed mapping of "Pre-Rapid ID" and "Rapid ID" call flows, including customer journey paths, decision points, and agent interactions, to visualise existing processes and identify pain points.
3. **Data Analysis and Root Cause Identification**: Utilised provided operational data (call arrival rates, hold times, talk times, resolution rates, staff schedules, and individual productivity) to perform a quantitative analysis. This involved calculating capacity, utilisation rates, and throughput to idemtify the precise drivers of delays and resource imbalances.
4. **Operational Research and Simulation Modelling**: Employed discrete-event simulation software (Simul8) to build accurate models of the RSU's call center operations under both the "Pre-Rapid ID" and "Rapid ID" configurations. This allowed for the validation of observed problems and the rigorous testing of hypothetical alternative process flows and resource allocation strategies.
5. **Solution Generation and Impact Assessment**: Based on analytical findings and simulation results, alternative operational models were developed. These models were then quantitatively assessed for their projected impact on key metrics such as average queueimg time, agent utilisation, and call resolution efficiency.


## Key Analysis and Highlights:
* Analysis revealed a paradox where initial hold times might have improved, but overall talk times and the rate of escalation to Senior Associates increased significantly under "Rapid ID".
* Quantification of Senior Associate workload demonstrated their over-utilisation and confirmed high customer wait times for their expertise, leading to frustration.
* Identified the unconstrained request for specific Senior Associates as a major contributor to queueing unpredictability and inefficient capacity planning.
* Simulations provided empirical evidence of how alternative call routing and resource management strategies could drastically reduce customer wait times and optimise staff deployment.

## Tools Utilised:
* **Simul8**: For discrete-event simulation modelling, scenario analysis, and performance prediction of call center operations.
* **Microsoft Excel**: For data organisation, preliminary calculations, and visualisations of operational metrics.
* **Lucidchart**: For visual representation of "as-is" and "to-be" call handling processes.

* Business Process Analysis and Re-engineering
* Operational Research and Optimisation
* Queueing Theory Application
